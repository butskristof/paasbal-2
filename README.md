# Paasbal
Static web site for a local event, hosted at https://paasbal.be/ .

## Technology 
The project uses following technologies:
* JavaScript ES6
* HTML5/SCSS 
* Webpack
* some helper npm libraries

## Building
While developing, a live server can be started with `npm run dev`. For production you should build the assets with `npm run build`.
This will generate some static resources you can host anywhere. All file links are relative so it should work in any subfolder.
